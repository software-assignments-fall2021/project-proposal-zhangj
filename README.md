# Mapping for Vegan/Vegetarian Restaurants
### By Jack Zhang

### Introduction

Many people in the world have begun to swing over from an omnivorous diet, to a vegetarian diet for health benefits and sometimes even moral reasons. However, in such cities such as NYC with a multitude of resturants to choose from, it can be hard for those who pursue this diet and find a restuarant to cater toward their needs.


### Proposal

We will develop out own map or list of sorts that can not only specify vegan/vegetarian restaurants, but also list out vegetarian options in those that also serve meat. This way even if there is not a vegetarian/vegan restaurant nearby, they can always find something to suit their dietary needs.

### Scope

This would mainly benefit vegetarians and vegans which are becoming more common and widespread throughout the globe. Since we are only focusing on vegetarian options, it may reasonably be completed in the span of this 14 week course. However, we would need to find out the vegetarian options of some restaurants, but for now we can limit the scope to simply vegetarian/vegan in Manhatten only and differentiate the two.


### Features

<ul>
  <li>Specify certain dietary conditions</li>
  <li>Find restaurants and dishes that fit those conditions</li>
  <li>View restaurants on map to discover best location</li>
</ul>


### How?
We would need to map out all the different locations of vegetarian restaurants as well as list them all. We would also have to categorize the two as well as list the menus or simply have a link to their site.
